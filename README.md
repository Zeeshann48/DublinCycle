Report:

I Start building this Application ‘Dublin Cycle’ on Android studio by watching Udemy tutorial video, which help me with some basic knowledge ,  my first step was to fetch Dublin Bike Api  and connect it with my android phone, For this I research on Google and watch some videos on YouTube related to it,   I was not getting JSON data in an array form , for this I  install JSON extension on google Chrome,  then I was able to fetched data from it, Next step to show JSON data on phone ,  I was trying to connect my phone but it was not connecting,  I got help from my Colleagues that I have to  go to my phone settings from there in ‘about phone’ I have to click 7 times on ‘build number’ to change into user phone to developer phone,  Another problem that came my phone was not connecting with windows, then I  installed phone Driver manually in windows, it connected with Android studio. Parsing Json into list was a very difficult part, I got many error in this part I was trying to create Markers with the loop but it was showing errors, after a lot of search on google, I figure out my errors, I was not dividing positions properly, after divided position into latitude and longitude, I was able to generate an array which can be linked and use in map. Finally my Application was build up successfully, Final part was to upload this project to GitHub, I watched few tutorial how to upload project on GitHub from android studio, and I found out for window user git.exe file need to downloaded, I downloaded it and then upload to GitHub. But my directory was not right. Then, I choose manually to locate the directory for git. I selected c-drive/programfiles/git/cmd/git.exe. And after it get fixed. I write configuration code to push my file to GitHub and it work.
